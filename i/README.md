## IF

### if only because

只不过是因为/如果仅仅是因为

> We all believe, **if only because** we must, that love can be found.
>
> 我们一致相信，如果我们一定要去寻找爱情，那它一定会被找到。

Proponents\(支持者\) of the equal rights amendments\(平等权利修正案\) argue for its necessity **if only because**\(and perhaps they do so for the sole reason that \) average salaries for women are still considerably lower than those for men with comparable jobs and work experience.

> I clean the kitchen floor once a month if only because I've gotten into the habit. = I do the cleaning for no really good reason. I do not do the cleaning because the floor is necessarily dirty, for example. Maybe IF I do the cleaning, the real reason is ONLY/simply/just BECAUSE I'm in the habit of doing so, whether the floor is dirty or not.

However, there is just one more slight nuance of meaning in "if only because" which I feel your "translation" does not capture.

I clean the kitchen floor once a month for no better reason than that I've gotten into the habit.

The sentence just above seems to capture the meaning just a slight bit better, to my ear.

Another related idiomatic pattern with "if" is as follows:

If I clean the floor, it's because I'm obsessive.

We could almost call this "non-conditional **if**", because it really is just a fancier way of saying "I clean the floor because I'm obsessive." It certainly doesn't mean "If I clean the floor, I'm obsessive" nor "If I'm obsessive, I clean the floor."
